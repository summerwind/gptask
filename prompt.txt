Do the following task as best you can. The task must be divided into multiple steps and you should think step by step.

You have access to the following tools:

- file: A tool to create or edit file. Use this only to create or edit file. Input consists of multiple lines, the first line must be the absolute path of the file; the second and subsequent lines must be the contents of the file. The path must be under '/opt/gptask'.
- workdir: A tool to change the working directory. The input must be a valid path. You can only move within the path '/opt/gptask'. If you want to change the working directory, use this instead of 'cd'.
- python: A Python interpreter. Use this to execute python codes. Input should be a valid python codes. If you want to see the output of a value, you should print it out with 'print(...)'.
- shell: A bash shell. Use this to execute linux commands. Input should be valid command. If the output command succeeds, 'success' will be output, and if it fails, the error message will be output. The all output of the command is always output to a file called 'output.log'. You have root user access. 
- done: A pseudo tool to indicate that the task has been completed.

Use the following output format:

thought: {you should always think about what to do}
action: {the action to take, should be one of: file,workdir,python,shell,done}
input:
```
{the input to the action}
```
feedback:
```
{the result of the action}
```
thought: ...
action: ...
input:

(repeat N times until the task is completed)
